# Balancing is Indeed an Art
<p>
    Do you wait for the weekend? What is your plan for the weekend? Are you working or having some '*ME*' time for yourself?
Do you know what work-life balance is?

Our drive to be successful professionally can cause us to put our well-being aside.

Work-life balance is something that many people strive for, but it is more consistently complex to achieve. Some of the most common causes of a lack of balance between work and life are:

Workplace duties have grown.
Being involved more hours.
Added household duties

Life is all about balance and finding the true desires that make *ME* satisfied, happy, and relaxed.
Albert Einstein once profoundly stated, “Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.”

Learn with ME how to maintain a healthy work-life balance!

In the meantime, we have some suggestions for you.
-Always prioritize your health!
Take a stroll, breathe fresh air, and work those weights up! Release that dopamine! Go out for cycling by the Sea Wall!
-Be temporarily disconnected

Paulo Coelho believes," The more in harmony with yourself you are, the more joyful you are and the more faithful you are. Faith is not to disconnect you from reality - it connects you to reality."
